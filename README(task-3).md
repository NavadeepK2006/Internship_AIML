Task 3: Linear Regression-Housing Price Prediction

Objective: To apply simple & multiple linear regression on the "Housing.csv" dataset and evaluate the model performance.

Tools Used:
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Matplotlib & Seaborn

Steps Followed:
1. Imported and preprocessed the dataset.
2. Split data into train-test sets.
3. Trained a Linear Regression model using sklearn.linear_model.
4. Evaluated the model using MAE, MSE, and R² score.
5. Plotted regression predictions and interpreted coefficients.

Model Performance:
MAE:970043.4  
MSE:1754318687330.6638  
R² Score:0.6529
